## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:

- The segmented control on the settings screen doesn't stay on the selected index, but it does translate onto the segmented control in the main view.
- Upon typing a bill amount, the total and tip amounts don't automatically appear; a tip percentage must be chosen first.
